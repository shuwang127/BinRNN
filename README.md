# BinRNN
The Provenance Analysis of Binary Code via Recurrent Neural Networks.

Usage: This is a reference program for the more advanced method `BinProv` to compare the experiemental results.

Both `BinRNN` and `BinProv` appear in the RAID 2020 paper: [BinProv: Binary Code Provenance Identification without Disassembly](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545948.3545956)

* You can find `BinProv` on github: [Viewer-HX/BinProv](https://github.com/Viewer-HX/BinProv)
